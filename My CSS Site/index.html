          Programming was my hobby for many years. I stopped  because I didn’t have enough free time. But, I was always near.
          I was a contact person to software company that was developing programs for the wholesale/retail company where I worked. That covered many issues from
          pointing the errors up to elaborating completely new programs or functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Few years ago I started learning new languages and to write programs again. I was programming in Python. And because I want to learn Javascript I started
          with The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp at Udemy, also refresh knowledge about HTML and CSS.
